# restaurant-reviews

Here I have written code to scrap restaurant reviews from food delivery sites named foodpanda.com and zomato.com

scroll.py scraps all the restaurant names in a particular city after taking input from user. Along with names it scraps average rating and url of restaurant and creates a csv(comma seperated) file with the data.
foodpanda@1.py file contains code that takes csv file created by scroll.py and scraps reviews of indivisual customers and created as many csv files as number of restaurants contaning indivisual customer reviews.

zomato_2a.py contains code that takes url of restaurant as input and creates csv file with top customer reviews and customer details to that particular restaurant.
